# Git+CLI Workshop - Agent Instructions

This is a bilingual teaching materials project (English + Korean).

## Key rules
- English is the canonical language; Korean is a translation
- When editing content docs, update BOTH en/ and ko/ versions
- Maintain consistent numbering between en/ and ko/ files
- Target audience: absolute beginners with zero CLI experience
- Every command must show: what to type, what happens, how to verify
- Use macOS-specific instructions (iTerm2, homebrew, etc.)
