# Git+CLI Workshop - Agent Instructions

This is a bilingual teaching materials project (English + Korean).

## Two-Repo Structure

The workshop uses two repos:
- **This repo** (`git-cli-workshop`) — teaching docs only; participants read these
- **Demo repo** (`git-cli-workshop-demo`) — participant playground; this is where exercises happen

When docs reference participant exercises, use the demo repo directory path (`~/workshop/git-cli-workshop-demo/`).

## Key rules
- English is the canonical language; Korean is a translation
- When editing content docs, update BOTH en/ and ko/ versions
- Maintain consistent numbering between en/ and ko/ files
- Target audience: absolute beginners with zero CLI experience
- Every command must show: what to type, what happens, how to verify
- Use macOS-specific instructions (iTerm2, homebrew, etc.)
- Cross-repo links use absolute GitHub URLs (https://github.com/isnbh0/git-cli-workshop-demo)
- Exercise working directory is always `~/workshop/git-cli-workshop-demo/`
- Docs repo should never contain practice/exercise files (SANDBOX.md, TODO.md, etc.)
